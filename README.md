For this project, my goal was to simulate a chessboard in the VM Emulater that Nand2Tetris provides.
To input a move, you have to use the following syntax and press Enter (make sure to not add any spaces and write everything in caps, since the machine reads the command very literally):

Chess positions: https://chessdelights.com/chess-positions/

If want to reset the whole game, you can instead enter "X" and press Enter. 

NOTE: the game doesn't have any prohibitions, so it won't stop you from moving your pieces into any position of the chessboard.

# Running the program
You can run the game locally with the software provided in the course, or you can use the web IDE.

## Using the web IDE
1. The easiest way is to run it directly on the web IDE provided by the creators. Just go to the website:
     https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/vm
2. In the VMCode section, add the whole "Chess" folder from this repository
3. Set the speed to the maximum (Fast)
4. Run the program
5. Enable the keyboard (the input speed is slow, but it works)

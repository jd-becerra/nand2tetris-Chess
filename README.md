# Chess Game for Nand2Tetris

For this project, my goal was to simulate a chessboard in the VM Emulator that Nand2Tetris provides. There are a lot of things to improve and iron out, but the goal was to learn about assembly code and use my newly acquired skills on a fun project.

To input a move, use the following syntax and press Enter (make sure to avoid spaces and write everything in caps, as the machine reads the command very literally):

To reset the game, enter "X" and press Enter.

**BE CAREFUL:** The game does not enforce any prohibitions, so you can move pieces to any position on the chessboard, even if it doesn't make any sense.

# Running the Program
You can run the game locally using the software provided in the Nand2Tetris course, or you can use the web IDE (recommended).

## Using the Web IDE

1. The easiest way is to run it directly on the web IDE provided by the creators. Go to the website:
     [Nand2Tetris Web IDE VMEmulator](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/vm)
2. In the VMCode section, add the entire "Chess" folder from this repository.
3. Set the speed to the maximum (Fast).
4. Run the program.
5. Enable the keyboard (the input speed is slow, but it works).
